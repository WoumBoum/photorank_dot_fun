# Guest Voting System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a guest voting system that allows anonymous users to vote with rate limiting before requiring signup.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Models
- **GuestVote**: Tracks guest votes with session ID, photo IDs, and hashed client info
- **GuestVoteLimit**: Rate limiting table with session-based vote counting

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/votes/guest`: Submit votes as guest user
- `GET /api/votes/guest/stats`: Get remaining guest votes
- `POST /auth/migrate-guest-votes`: Convert guest votes to user votes after signup

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **10 votes per session** (24-hour session duration)
- **IP and User Agent hashing** for privacy
- **Session-based tracking** with cookie fallback

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Automatic fallback to guest voting when not authenticated
- Real-time vote counter display
- Signup prompts when votes are running low
- Graceful limit reached messaging

### 5. Security Features
- No PII collection from guests
- Hashed client information for rate limiting
- Separate rate limits from authenticated users
- Secure cookie-based session tracking

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `app/guest_utils.py`: Guest voting utilities and rate limiting logic
- `alembic/versions/add_guest_voting_tables.py`: Database migration
- `test_guest_voting.py`: Utility function tests

### Modified Files
- `app/models.py`: Added GuestVote and GuestVoteLimit models
- `app/routers/votes.py`: Added guest voting endpoints
- `app/routers/auth.py`: Added vote migration endpoint
- `app/static/js/app.js`: Frontend guest voting integration

## Usage

### For Guests
1. Visit the voting page without logging in
2. Vote on photos (counter shows remaining votes)
3. After 10 votes, prompted to sign up
4. Sign up to convert guest votes to permanent account

### For Developers
- Guest votes use same ELO calculation as authenticated votes
- Rate limits configurable via `GUEST_VOTE_LIMIT` constant
- Session management handles browser cookie restrictions

## Safety Features
- **No authentication bypass**: Guest votes don't affect user data
- **Separate rate limits**: Independent from user upload limits
- **Privacy protection**: IP/user agent hashing with salt
- **Audit logging**: Guest vote patterns trackable for abuse detection

## Testing
Run `python test_guest_voting.py` to verify utility functions work correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Apply database migration: `alembic upgrade head`
2. Test with actual voting flow
3. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
4. Adjust limits based on real-world usage
